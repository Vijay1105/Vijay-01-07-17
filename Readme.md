Java Assignment @ Zycus.

A small library that provide a disk backed map implementation for storing large number of key value pairs. The map implementations (HashMap, HashTable) max out around 3-4Million keys/GB of memory for very simple key/value pairs and in most cases the limit is much lower. DiskBacked map on the other hand can store betweeen 16Million (64bit JVM) to 20Million(32bit JVM) keys/GB, regardless the size of the key/value pairs. It is Serializable to disk and provide API level Tuning configurations, Where ever applicable.

Library/ Jar file used: Hessian-4.0.38 jetty-6.1.26 jetty-util-7.0.0. pre5 servlet-api-3.0.20100224
